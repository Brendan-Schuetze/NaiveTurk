  <h3>What is nvt?</h3>
    <p><b>Short Answer</b>
      <p>We are a group of scientists working towards increasing
      the quality of data gathered by ourselves and other researchers recruiting from online samples.</p>

    <p><b>Long Answer</b>
      <p>nvt.science is a database for researchers in the social sciences who run
      experiments online. This service helps researchers do two things:
      <ul>
        <li>Track bots
        <li>Determine who has or has not participated in similar experiments before
      </ul>
      <p>The MTurk research pools and other online services are
        <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/publications/harris/StewartEtAl_JDM_MTurk.pdf">not as large</a> or
        diverse as we might think. And the issues related to survey spam are clear.
        Both the issues of bots and unknown levels of participant naivete have
        <a href="https://rdcu.be/4hxY">documented</a> impacts on the quality of scientific research.
