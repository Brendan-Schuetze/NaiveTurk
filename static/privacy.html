  <center><h1>nvt.science & Privacy</h1></center>
  <h3>How we protect the privacy of workers on MTurk and other platforms</h3>
      <p><b>What we do:</b> We implement a variety of industry standard security tools, such as TLS/HTTPS.
      Additionally, we hash all incoming worker ids. Hashing is a computer
      science techniques which converts readable strings such as "nvt.science" into an
      unrecognizable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization">pseudonym</a>, such as
      "c400eb28ecf0c0bac883c9406b595c56". Additionally, we require that
      all researchers using this service follow the guidelines below.

      <br><br><b>What our researchers do:</b> Only academics may register to nvt.science. This
      site may not be used for commercial purposes. Registered researchers must
      ask consent from any worker before sending their data to nvt.science.
      Additionally, they must not share any data from studies involving medical data
      or any sensitive data. nvt.science is designed for integration into low-risk
      psychology experiments in the cognitive or social domain – not for clinical research.

  <h3>I would like to my MTurk ID removed from nvt.science's database</h3>
  <p>We understand that some people may change their mind after consenting to the use of this service previously.
    If you would like to be removed from our database, please email your MTurk ID to Brendan.Schuetze[at]utexas.edu</p>
